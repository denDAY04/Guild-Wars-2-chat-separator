Guild-Wars-2-chat-separator
===========================

A small program for separating messages into segments sized for GW2 chat. 

The MMORPG by ArenaNet, Guild Wars 2, has a relatively low character-count limit in its chat box (199 chars).
So I decided to make a small program, just for the fun of it, that would read a message input from the console and 
output the message in segements sized for the chat limitation. This tool is mostly intede for Role-play purposes in that
it retains the mesage pre-fix (e.g. /e for emote, or /s for say) since Guild Wars 2 does not save /e as a default chat 
channel.
